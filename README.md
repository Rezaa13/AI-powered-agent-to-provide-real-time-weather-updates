# AI-powered-agent-to-provide-real-time-weather-updates
I’ve been working on building an AI-powered agent capable of providing real-time weather updates using OpenAI and live data sources.

This AI agent can:
✅ Chat and respond to basic queries
✅ Remember past interactions using simple memory
🌦️ Fetch live weather data in real-time
📧 Send personalized weather updates directly to your email

It’s been exciting to see how easily we can connect tools like OpenAI and public APIs to automate useful tasks with no-code platforms like n8n!

I collected the weather API from : https://open-meteo.com/

🔧 Tech stack: OpenAI API, n8n workflows, weather API, email integrations, automation
